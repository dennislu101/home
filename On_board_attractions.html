      <h2>Things to do on board.</h2>
      <h3>SPAS</h3>
	  The Norwegian Breakaway has a very modern, beautiful Day Spa, Medi Spa, <br>
	  Salon and Fitness Center operated by Mandara Spa – spanning 23,000 square feet<br>
	  and encompassing two decks. There are over 50 spa treatments including Elemis<br>
	  facials, Bamboo or hot-stone massages, and even an oxygen treatment from bliss®.<br>
	  Norwegian Breakaway also has acupuncture, teeth whitening<br>
	  and cosmetic medical treatments, performed by a licensed medi-spa doctor, <br>
	  such as Botox® Cosmetic, Dysport(TM), Restylane® and Perlane®.<br>
	  In the Breakaway’s Thermal Suite, you can melt away your stress in heated loungers,<br>
	  hot tubs, the vitality pool, steam rooms and a dry sauna. <br>
	  Within the Thermal Suite is one of the most anticipated additions to Norwegian’s <br>
	  spa lineup – the Salt Room. Very trendy, salt therapy has been proven to alleviate respiratory <br>
	  and skin ailments, strengthen the immune system, promote better sleep and have a long-term<br>
	  positive impact on overall lung function. <br>
	  <p>
      </p>
	  <h3>Sports Court and others</h3>
	  <p>The Norwegian Breakaway has a full and luxurious sports court<br>
	  including basketball soccer and tennis facilities!! The court<br>
	 Competitions are hosted every day. The top deck is also home<br>
	 to something called a skywalk which is basically like a ropes<br>
	 course. What's impressive is that there is a plank that spans<br>
	 eight feet over the side of the ship so it feels like you are<br>
	 about to fall! There is also a rock climbing facility and a mini<br>
	 golf course.
	 </p>
	 <h3> Water fun!</h3>
	 <p>The Breakaway has two main pools and two hot tubs. They are comfortable<br>
	 in size and the hot tubs according to a website is around 39.4 degrees<br>
	 celsius which is more than comfortable. The Breakaway also has five water<br>
	 slides making it the largest water park of the Norwegian Cruise Line.<br>
	 The most notable one is the twin free-fall one where it is essentially<br>
	 a waterslide that vertically drops you from a two story height and twist<br>
	 and tangle through the tubes. It is also a double, meaning that you can<br>
	 race your friends.
	 </P>
	 <h3>Entertainment</h3>
	 <p> There are a wide variety of shows on board including Burn the Floor and<br>
	 The Second City. Also the shows are average, they are worth going for because<br>
	 they are unique. I mean who watches shows in the middle of the ocean? What I do<br>
	 recommend is the casino for adults as there are a wide variety of games that<br>
	 that you could waste your money on. A wide variety of bars also means that you<br>
	 could waste some more money on beers and cocktails to get drunk on. And the perfect<br>
	 place to do that, would be of course..at the many bars on the ship.
