      <h2>Introduction.</h2>
      <p>The Breakaway with it's sister the "Getaway" were the first two fleets of ships in "Project Breakaway." The<br>
         two ships were named through an online contest by Kimberly Powell on September 14, 2011. <br>
         <br>
         Construction of the Norwegian Breakaway began on September 21, 2011 when the first piece of steel was cut in<br>
         Papenburg, Germany. On August 25, 2013, the Breakaway was completely assembled. After many inaugural events<br>
         she started her transatlantic voyage from Southhampton to New York City where the naming ceremony took place.<br>
         <br>
         New York City became her new home port. And on May 12, 2013, she set sail on her first voyage to the Bermudas.<br>
         However, a few months after her departures, several incidents happened, including a woman falling two decks from<br>
         her exterior balcony, and toddler fell off of a bunk. Therefore, in 2018, the ship was refurbished. <br>
         <br>
         Now the ship travels to the Bermudas from May through September and the Bahamas October through April.
